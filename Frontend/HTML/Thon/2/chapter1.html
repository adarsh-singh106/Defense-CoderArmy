            <p>Before diving into web development, we must understand the internet. Think of it as a global network of
                computers that communicate with each other. The core purpose is <strong>communication and data
                    transfer</strong>. It's like a giant digital post office system.</p>

            <p>Sending data online is very similar to sending a parcel:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Parcel:</strong> This is your data (a message, a photo, a file).</li>
                <li><strong>Your Address (Sender):</strong> This is your IP Address.</li>
                <li><strong>Recipient's Address:</strong> This is the destination IP Address.</li>
                <li><strong>The Post Office System:</strong> This is the network of routers and cables that figures out
                    the best path to deliver your data.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Core Components Explained</h2>


            <h3>1. IP Address (Internet Protocol)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assests/images/chapter1/IP.png" alt="Illustration of the Internet" width="250" height="250"
                    title="The Internet - Global Network">
                <figcaption><em>The Internet: A global network of connected computers.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It's
                the "home address" for your device on the internet.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IPv4:</strong> The older version, like <code>192.168.1.1</code>. It's a 32-bit number and
                    can support about 4.3 billion devices. We ran out of these!</li>
                <li><strong>IPv6:</strong> The new version, like <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>.
                    It's a 128-bit number that provides a practically infinite number of addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic IP:</strong> Your ISP (Internet Service Provider like Jio, Airtel) gives you a
                    temporary IP address when you connect to the internet. It can change the next time you connect.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. MAC Address (Media Access Control)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assests/images/chapter1/MAC-ADD.png" alt="Illustration of the Internet" width="250" height="250"
                    title="The Internet - Global Network">
                <figcaption><em>The Internet: A global network of connected computers.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is the <strong>permanent, physical address</strong> of your device's network hardware (like your
                WiFi card). It's burned into the device by the manufacturer and cannot be changed easily. While your IP
                address is like your temporary home address, the MAC address is like your government ID number - it's
                uniquely yours.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Why do we need both?</strong> If your internet disconnects and your IP is given to someone else
                (like your dad's phone!), the MAC address ensures that sensitive data meant for you (like Anjali's chat
                😉) doesn't get delivered to him, because the delivery packet checks both the IP and the MAC address.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>3. DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assests/images/chapter1/DNS.png" alt="Illustration of the Internet" width="250" height="250"
                    title="The Internet - Global Network">
                <figcaption><em>The Internet: A global network of connected computers.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Humans are bad at remembering numbers (IP addresses). We're good with names (like
                <code>google.com</code>). The DNS is the "phonebook of the internet." When you type a domain name into
                your browser:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Your computer asks a DNS server, "What is the IP address for google.com?"</li>
                <li>The DNS server looks it up and replies, "The IP is <code>142.250.196.78</code>."</li>
                <li>Your browser then connects to that IP address to get the website.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>4. Port Numbers</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assests/images/chapter1/POrt NO.png" alt="Illustration of the Internet" width="250" height="250"
                    title="The Internet - Global Network">
                <figcaption><em>The Internet: A global network of connected computers.</em></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>An IP address gets data to the right <em>device</em>, but a port number gets it to the right
                <em>application</em> on that device. Your computer can run many things at once (Chrome, WhatsApp,
                Spotify). A port number is like an apartment number in a building.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Port 80:</strong> For standard web traffic (HTTP).</li>
                <li><strong>Port 443:</strong> For secure web traffic (HTTPS).</li>
                <li>When you open multiple tabs in Chrome, each tab is assigned a temporary, high-numbered port to keep
                    the data separate.</li>
            </ul>
