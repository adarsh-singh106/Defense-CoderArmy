      <h2>Quick Notes</h2>
      <p>This sample plan aims for a moderate calorie surplus (for many people, about +300–600 kcal/day) and includes protein at each meal to support lean mass gain when combined with resistance training. If you have medical conditions, food allergies, or specific dietary needs, seek professional guidance.</p>

      <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose energy-dense foods: nuts, seeds, full-fat dairy, nut butters, avocados, dried fruit, and healthy oils to increase calories without huge volume.</li>
        <li>Include protein at every meal — aim to meet protein needs (see protein targets below) especially if doing resistance training.</li>
        <li>If appetite is low, drink smoothies/shakes that combine milk, fruit, nut butter, and a protein powder if available.</li>
        <li>Do regular strength training (resistance exercises) to convert extra calories into muscle rather than only fat.</li>
        <li>Weigh yourself weekly under consistent conditions and adjust calorie intake every 1–2 weeks if weight isn't increasing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="protein-targets">
      <h2>Protein Targets</h2>
      <p>A commonly used range for people doing resistance training is approximately <strong>1.2–2.0 g of protein per kg of body weight per day</strong>. Adjust according to activity level and goals; if unsure, aim for the lower end and increase if you are training hard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="grocery">
      <h2>Grocery Ideas (mix & match)</h2>
      <p>Whole milk, paneer, eggs, chicken, fish, oats, rice, whole-wheat flour/rotis, peanut butter, almonds/walnuts, chia/flax seeds, avocados, potatoes, full-fat yogurt, olive/vegetable oil, dried fruits (raisins, dates), bananas, and other fruits you like.</p>

    <section id="safety">
      <h2>Safety & When to Seek Help</h2>
      <p>If you are underweight due to illness, sudden weight loss, or poor appetite for a prolonged period, consult a healthcare professional. For personalised calorie targets, macronutrient breakdown, or meal planning (e.g., vegetarian/vegan adaptations), see a registered dietitian.</p>
